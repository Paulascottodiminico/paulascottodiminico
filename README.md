### Hi there! I am Paula Scotto di Minico, 22 years old and a information science student üëã

I always thought my dream was to become a doctor with a specialization in neurosurgery, because there are only a few of them. How awesome?! But I ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù came into contact with programming by helping my little brother with a project for informatics. And that is where it all started.

Two years ago I started a study communication and multimedia design and I loved designing websites, I really do, however HTML and CSS caught my eye. That is why I started with the study information science, which focused more on modelling information systems and programming skills.

I am Paula Scotto di Minico, a second year information science student at University Utrecht. My specialities include good communication, problem solving, quickly learning new (software)skills, perseverance, working together, designing websites and modelling information systems for companies.

So far, I have worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Git/GitHub, PHP, note.js, ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams) and DFD (Data Flow Diagrams). I am still enthusiastically grabbing other programming- and modelling languages!

I am constantly looking for new adventures and working to improve my skills. There is certainly more to learn, more to build and more problems to solve. And for this, I am grateful.
